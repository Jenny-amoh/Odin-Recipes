            <h4>The signature Ekwang</h4>
            I chose to launch with this dish because it’s a recipe very close to my heart. It’s a Cameroonian dish that 
            originates from my mother’s tribe, the Oroko people in Ndian Division in the Southwest Region of Cameroon. 
            When I was young, we used to cook this dish very frequently. Ekwang is an arduous dish consisting of several 
            steps including the peeling, grating, and wrapping of cocoyam paste into cocoyam leaves. It is then seasoned with flavor-filled spices unique to Cameroon.

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Grate the cocoyams on the largest surface of the grater to form the cocoyam paste.
                    Then,Aerate the cocoyam paste by continuously beating to reach a fluffy texture. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wash the collard greens, remove the middle vein from each leaf and carefully cut it into palm size pieces. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grease the inside of a pot with about 1/2 cup of palm oil and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scoop a teaspoon of the grated cocoyam paste onto a piece of the cut collard green 
                    and wrap tightly by rolling the leaf with your fingers. From time to time, aerate 
                    the cocoyam paste as you are wrapping to maintain the fluffy texture. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a blender or food processor, combine garlic cloves, ginger, green onions, habanero, parsley and 1/4 cup of water. 
                    Blend until it forms a creamy fresh spice blend
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the wrapped Ekwang into the greased pot in a crisscross pattern and 
                    Continue to place each wrapped Ekwang in this pattern until your cocoyam paste is finished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add smoked fish, sprinkle this layer with crayfish, blended peppers, salt, maggi and place the pot on a stove with 2 cups of water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow to cook for about 25 minutes under medium-low heat, add more water, avoid stiring, adjust seasoning and serve after the ekwang after 35 more minutes.
