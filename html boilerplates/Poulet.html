            <h4>The signature poulet-DG</h4>
            Poulet, is the French word for Chicken.  DG stands for “Directeur Général”  Direct translation for this dish reads Director General Chicken. 
            It’s one of those dishes saved for special guests. In fact, I still reserve it for special occasion, in my case dinner at home with  some good company. 
            Sometimes I brood over what made it so special such that it  graced mom’s dinner table only when my father’s work colleagues  were coming over.
