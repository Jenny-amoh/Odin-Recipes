            <h4>A sweet Eru recipe</h4>
            Nothing delivers flavor and finger-licking goodness with little fuss and even less time than Eru soup. 
            <br>
            When I decided to start a cooking and lifestyle blog, the first recipe that crossed my mind was eru. 
            It was at the top of my list of recipes to make, for the blog, because I have been cooking for a very 
            long time and if there is any dish that I knoe how to cook really well, it’s Eru. So it would only feel 
            natural to start with it. I kept putting it off, in favor of other new recipes.

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the beef in bite size chunks, season with salt, Maggi, and onions and cook until tender. 
                    Do same for the cow skin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use very little water while cooking the meat because eru does not need a lot of water . 
                    However, make sure you have at least 2 to 3 cups of stock from the beef. to use in cooking this dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the meat is cooking soak the dried Ukazi/Eru leaves in water in a bowl to tenderize the leaves for 
                    approximately 3-4 minutes. Rinse and drain
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the assorted meats, cow skin, dried fish to a large stock pot with at least 2 cups of stock. 
                    Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>
                    In a blender or food processor, combine garlic cloves, ginger, green onions, habanero, parsley and 1/4 cup of water. 
                    Blend until it forms a creamy fresh spice blend
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arrange, slice and rinse your water leaves or spinach and add to the pot of assorted meat and fish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add crayfish and 2 tablespoon bouillon/ Maggi at this point stir, let it cook on medium heat (approximately 2 minutes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add shredded Ukazi/Eru leaves, and red oil. Stir again thoroughly making sure all the contents in the pot blend together .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simmer for another 10 minutes, add stock /water if needed . The fragrant smell that erupts from the dish lets you know it is time to eat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season to taste with salt and more Maggi as needed. ( I usually season my food with salt and Maggie as the dish progresses .)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Totally yummy. It’s an eruption of flavours in one’s mouth. </p>
